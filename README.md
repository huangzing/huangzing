- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @huangzing, a student.
- ğŸŒ± Everything is too hard for me, so I must try my best to do it better.
- ğŸ˜­ If you find something I did is wrong, please let me know, any simple mistake is a really big problem for me!
- ğŸ˜¨ Sorry for my broken English.
- ğŸ¤£ Hope it's a good start!
